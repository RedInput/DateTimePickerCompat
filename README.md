# DateTimePickerCompat

DateTimePickerCompat is a backport version of the official [DateTimePicker][1] for Android 4.2.2+.


Usage
-----

Using this library is exactly the same as using the official one.

First of all you need to get a new instance of the dialog you want to use:

<pre><code>// For DatePickerDialog
DatePickerDialog dialog = DatePickerDialog.newInstance(OnDateSetListener, year, month, day);

// For TimePickerDialog
TimePickerDialog dialog = TimePickerDialog.newInstance(OnTimeSetListener, hour, minutes, is24HourMode);
</code></pre>


With an instance of the Dialog to use the next step is to show it:

<pre><code>// The structure is the same on both cases 
dialog.show(FragmentManager, Tag);
</code></pre>
